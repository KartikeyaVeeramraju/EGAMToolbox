## Installation

Clone or Download the git repository and run `EGAM_toolbox.mltbx` to add the `lib` folder to your MATLAB path. You should then be able to use the EGAM core functions listed in the `lib` folder.


    
## Getting started

To understand the use case, please install the toolbox on your end and navigate to `EGAMToolbox/Examples/` and go through the `init_script.m` and `Inverter_model.m` files. 

If you just want to see some simulation results and code documentation to get started, navigate to `EGAMToolbox/Examples/html/` and open `inverter_model.html` and `init_script.html`
